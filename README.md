## Project 2 - Knights of Avril
In this github repository you will find our README.md file, LICENSE.md file, SRC, Data, and Figures folders. Our README.md file (the file you are currently reading) will serve as a guide to what is contained in our repository. Our LICENSE.md file explains how visitors can interact with this repository. The SRC folder contains all of our source code for the project. The Data folder contains our dataset. Finally, our Figures folder contains all our graphs we created to explore our hypothesis.

### SRC
#### Installing Code
You can download our code from this repository in the SRC folder.

#### Usage of Code
You can use our code by opening the file in the SRC folder, as detailed above, in R Studio and ensuring the data is downloaded and all necessary packages/libraries are installed and loaded.

### DATA
You can access our data from this repository in the DATA folder.

Our data was used to explore our hypothesis: *Our model will be able to accurately predict the stage of Alzheimer’s present in each brain scan with an accuracy of 90%.*
| Variable | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Non Demented | Image | Images of brain scans from patients who are in the earliest stage of Alzheimer’s progression and are not having symptoms of dementia |
| Very Mild Demented | Image | Images of brain scans from patients who are in the 2nd stage of Alzheimer’s progression and are having very slight symptoms of dementia |
| Mild Demented | Image | Images of brain scans from patients who are in the 3rd stage of Alzheimer’s progression and are having slight symptoms of dementia |
| Moderate Demented | Image | Images of brain scans from patients who are in the 4th stage of Alzheimer’s progression and are having moderate symptoms of dementia |
